# ML Dataset Utilities

Various useful ML Dataset Utilities, for Diffusion, LLMs, etc.

* [Bing Image Downloader](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/Bing_Downloader_with_Tags) - Script to download images from Bing, and save the Title/Metadata as a TXT file. Also parses videos and extracts Key-Frames.
* [IPTC / EXIF Utilities](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/IPTC_EXIF) - Utilies for IPTC/EXIF: IPTC to .TXT, .TXT to IPTC, etc.
* [Image Manipulation](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/Image_Manipulation) - Resizing, Renaming
* [Image Sorting](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/Image_Sorting) - Script for sorting images based on TF-IDF vectorization of pixel clusters. Finds identical / similar images. Turns pixels in a 6-Character hex "Word", tokenizes, and renames the files based on the TF-IDF rankings.
* [Image Tagging](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/Image_Tagging) - Rewrite to utilize SmilingWolf's WD 1.4 V2 Tagging Models. ~65-70 it/s Image Tagging. Work in Progress. Just wrote it last night (2023-06-11)
* [Outlook MSG Parsing -> MSSQL](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/Outlook_MSG_Parsing) - Parsing Outlook .MSG files, extracting information, and inserting into an MS-SQL Server. Includes the MSSQL Query for creating the Tables. Work in Progress. To be added: Summarization, better email/entity recognition, better address/phone number recognition, Chronological Plot Summaries.
* [Whisper Transcription](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/Transcription) - Custom script to generate TXT/JSON files by running OpenAI's Whisper Transcription Models.
* [WIP_All_In_One](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/WIP_All_In_One) - HC SVNT DRACONES 
* [CPrint Functions for Colours](https://github.com/Daemon0ps/Dataset_Utilities/tree/main/Colormod_CPrint_Functions) - Importable group of colour functions for using CPrint, eg:  cp_y("Yellow")  cp_r("Red")
