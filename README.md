  Resize and Save as MD5
  PIL.ImageOps.contain()  and save with MD5 hashlib calculation

PIL_contain_threaded.py

  Also extracts keyframes from video files
  
classmates_yearbooks.py
  hehehehe

color_ngram_sort.py

  i accidentally copied about 300k images from multiple post-processing sources together, 
  but i pondered what i would do if they all werent backed up these were all lossy JPGs and MD5s don't match even though nearly identical, 
  so i wrote a python script to blur everything slightly, contain the images to a (64,64) pixel size constraint, 
  sliced the array to (-1,4) and re-mapped the RGBA  colour palette by summing the RGB values and adding a slight normalization function
  converted the normalized values into hex values then joined the array into a string of 4,096 hex "words", 
  then tokenized them and used tf-idf to rank the word cluster frequencies then rename for the top 10 sorted words + md5 + zfill(4)
  
  good for finding duplicate pictures with different MD5s, or like-pictures

colormod.py
  just a bunch of color functions for text output
